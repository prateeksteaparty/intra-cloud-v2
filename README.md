# IntraCloud – A SaaS-Based File Storage Platform

IntraCloud is a lightweight, full-stack cloud storage platform that allows users to securely sign up, log in, and upload files — similar to a simplified Google Drive. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), it enables users to manage personal files through a clean and modern interface.

## 🔧 Features

- 🔐 User authentication (signup/login with JWT)
- ☁️ File upload functionality (client to server to DB)
- 🧾 Dashboard to view uploaded files
- 🗂 Organized folder-like UI (optional future improvement)
- 🧱 Built with MERN stack
- 📦 Ready for Docker containerization

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Cloud Ready**: Docker support (coming soon)
